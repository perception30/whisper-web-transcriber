Excellent. http://localhost:8000/index2.html working great.                                     
Since we have already built the wasm and other modules,
Create a publishable npm module which makes is super easy to consume this 
very efficiently. So that consumers does not have to manually build, include it in header, call API etc.

Will it work in all OS browsers? or do we need to build wasm for each os?
